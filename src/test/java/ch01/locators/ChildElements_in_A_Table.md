In scenarios where checkbox IDs are unique but do not contain any phrase directly associated with the user's name, 
the most logical and recommended approach is 
to start from the user's name and navigate to the corresponding checkbox ID. 
This means that even though each checkbox has a distinct ID, 
these IDs do not directly correlate to user names. 
For instance, an ID like user128_admin might be unique but doesn't directly tell us 
it belongs to a user named "Nash".

Therefore, in such cases, the reliable method is 
to begin at the td element containing the user's name 
and then find the relevant checkbox in that row. 
This approach ensures accurate identification of specific checkboxes for each user, 
even when the checkbox IDs don't directly relate to the user names. 
This is a particularly effective method in environments where checkbox IDs are unique per user 
but don't have a direct naming relationship with the users.

In the context of finding a specific user's checkbox, 
it still makes sense to locate the td containing the user's name 
and then navigate to the relevant checkbox within that row. 
This method provides a dependable way to correctly locate user-specific checkboxes 
when checkbox IDs are not directly linked to user names.

When the checkbox IDs are independent and not directly related to user names, 
the most reliable and recommended method is to start from the row 
containing the user's name and then navigate to the corresponding checkbox ID. 
This method ensures the correct identification of the targeted checkbox even in situations 
where the checkbox ID does not directly indicate its association with a user name. 
This approach is highly effective for automation processes using Selenium WebDriver.

In summary, when dealing with checkbox IDs that are unique but not directly associated with user names, 
the best practice is to navigate from the parent element (the td containing the user's name) 
to the child element (the relevant checkbox). 
This ensures accurate identification of specific checkboxes for each user, regardless of
whether the checkbox IDs directly correlate to user names.

This approach can be implemented in Selenium WebDriver as follows: 
First, find the td element containing Nash's name, 
then locate the checkbox with the ID user128_admin in the same row. 
This method effectively locates the correct checkbox, 
even when the checkbox ID doesn't directly relate to the user's name.

Let's start by finding the td element containing the user's name, 
and then accurately locate the relevant checkboxes in that row:

First, find the td containing Nash's name
WebElement nashRow = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//td[text()='Nash']"));

Find the checkbox in Nash's row that corresponds to 'Admin' access
WebElement adminCheckbox = nashRow.findElement(By.xpath("following-sibling::td//input[@id='user128_admin']"));

Perform a checkbox check
boolean isAdminChecked = adminCheckbox.isSelected();

Test verification
assertTrue("Nash should have admin access", isAdminChecked);

This code finds the "Admin" checkbox for Nash 
by first locating the td element containing Nash's name 
and then accessing the checkbox with the ID user128_admin in the same row. 
This method ensures the correct checkbox is identified, even in situations 
where the checkbox ID is not directly correlated with the user's name.
