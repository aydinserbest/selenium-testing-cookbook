In HTML, 
the <table>, <tr>, and <td> tags are commonly used for creating and displaying table data. 
These tags are fundamental parts of HTML 
and are widely used as a standard way to present data in a structured and readable format on web pages.

The <table> tag is used to initiate a table and defines the overall structure of the table.
The <tr> tag stands for "table row" and represents a row in the table.
The <td> tag, short for "table data," contains the data in a cell of the table.
In your example, 
you're using Selenium WebDriver to extract table data from a web page. 
Your code locates a table with the ID #items, 
finds each row (<tr>) within this table, 
and then iterates through each cell (<td>) in the rows to print out the text content. 
This approach is a common method for automatically extracting and processing table data from web pages.

These tags are typically used for these purposes and are considered a standard for representing tables in web pages.
